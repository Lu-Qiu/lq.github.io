My name is Lu Qiu, a first-year MS Biostatistics student at Columbia University. This is my personal website created for P8105 Homework 4.

This website contains:

* A brief introductory landing page
* A [resume](resume.html) page
* A flexdashboard using the NY NOAA dataset
* Links in the site navigation for my GitHub account, your email, and LinkedIn



Here is a [link](https://github.com/Lu-Qiu/lu-qiu.github.io) to the code for creating this website.
